# double-helix
Arduino code to run a 15x2 double helix via FastLED library.

The code was taken from another project on the 'net - sorry I can't recall which one otherwise I'd reference it from here.  I then simply adjusted it to fit my requirements for 2x 15 LED strips.

Things to note: 
 * The signal wire has to be connected to the right end of the strip - there is only one right connection.
